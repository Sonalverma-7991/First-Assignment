    "3. Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, objects can be categorized as either mutable or immutable. This classification is based on whether or not the object's state (its data) can be modified after it is created. Here’s a comparison and examples to illustrate the differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable Objects\n",
    "Mutable objects can have their values changed after they are created. This means that you can modify the content of the object without creating a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Mutable Objects: lists, dictionaries, sets, byte arrays, and most user-defined classes.\n",
    "List Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a mutable list\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modifying the list\n",
    "my_list[0] = 10\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding an element to the list\n",
    "my_list.append(4)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "Dictionary Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a mutable dictionary\n",
    "my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modifying the dictionary\n",
    "my_dict['a'] = 10\n",
    "print(my_dict)  # Output: {'a': 10, 'b': 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding a new key-value pair\n",
    "my_dict['c'] = 3\n",
    "print(my_dict)  # Output: {'a': 10, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n",
    "Immutable Objects\n",
    "Immutable objects cannot have their values changed after they are created. Any modification to an immutable object results in the creation of a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Immutable Objects: integers, floats, strings, tuples, frozensets, and bytes.\n",
    "String Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an immutable string\n",
    "my_string = \"hello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Attempting to modify the string (this creates a new string)\n",
    "new_string = my_string.replace('h', 'j')\n",
    "print(my_string)   # Output: hello\n",
    "print(new_string)  # Output: jello\n",
    "Tuple Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an immutable tuple\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Attempting to modify the tuple (this will raise an error)\n",
    "# my_tuple[0] = 10  # This line would raise a TypeError\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a new tuple with the desired changes\n",
    "new_tuple = (10, 2, 3)\n",
    "print(my_tuple)   # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "print(new_tuple)  # Output: (10, 2, 3)\n",
    "Key Differences\n",
    "Modification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable: Can be changed in place without creating a new object. Examples include lists and dictionaries.\n",
    "Immutable: Cannot be changed in place; any modification results in a new object. Examples include strings and tuples.\n",
    "Memory Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable: More efficient when frequent changes are required since modifications are made in place.\n",
    "Immutable: Potentially less efficient for frequent changes as new objects are created for each modification.\n",
    "Hashability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable: Generally not hashable, so they cannot be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets.\n",
    "Immutable: Hashable (if they contain only hashable elements), so they can be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets.\n",
    "Thread Safety:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable: Not inherently thread-safe because their state can be changed by multiple threads simultaneously.\n",
    "Immutable: Inherently thread-safe because their state cannot be changed once created.\n",
    "Practical Implications\n",
    "Use mutable objects when you need to make frequent changes to the data and need the changes to be reflected across all references to the object.\n",
    "Use immutable objects when you need a constant value that should not be altered or when you need to ensure the integrity of the data across different parts of a program.\n",
    "Understanding these differences helps in selecting the right type of objects based on the specific needs of your program."

    "5. explain the concept of type casting in Python with examples.\n",
    "Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting one data type into another. In Python, this can be done using built-in functions. Type casting is useful when you need to perform operations that require operands of a specific type, or when you want to explicitly control how data is handled in your program. Python supports several types of type casting, which can be categorized as either implicit or explicit.\n",

    "Implicit type casting (or coercion) is automatically performed by the Python interpreter when it encounters mixed types in an expression. It promotes smaller types to larger types to prevent data loss.\n",

    "7.Describe the different types of loops in Python and their use cases with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides several types of loops to repeat a block of code multiple times. The main types of loops in Python are for and while loops. Each type of loop has its own use cases and can be used to solve different problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. for Loop\n",
    "The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or any other iterable object. It is commonly used when you need to execute a block of code a fixed number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "for variable in sequence:\n",
    "    # Block of code to execute\n",
    "Example - Iterating over a list\n",
    "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# apple\n",
    "# banana\n",
    "# cherry\n",
    "Example - Using range():\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# 0\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "# 2\n",
    "# 3\n",
    "# 4\n",
    "Example - Iterating over a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
    "for key, value in person.items():\n",
    "    print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# name: Alice\n",
    "# age: 25\n",
    "# city: New York\n",
    "2. while Loop\n",
    "The while loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true. It is useful when you do not know beforehand how many times you need to execute the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # Block of code to execute\n",
    "Example - Basic while loop:\n",

    "    count += 1\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# 0\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "# 2\n",
    "# 3\n",
    "# 4\n",

    "while True:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",

    "3. Loop Control Statements\n",
    "Python provides several control statements that can be used within loops to control their execution. These include break, continue, and pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "break\n",
    "The break statement is used to exit the loop prematurely when a certain condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - Using break:\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    if i == 5:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# 0\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "# 2\n",
    "# 3\n",
    "# 4\n",
    "continue\n",
    "The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration and continue with the next iteration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - Using continue:\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    if i % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "# 3\n",
    "# 5\n",
    "# 7\n",
    "# 9\n",
    "pass\n",
    "The pass statement is a null operation that is used as a placeholder in situations where a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - Using pass:\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    if i == 3:\n",
    "        pass  # Placeholder, does nothing\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(i)\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# 0\n",
